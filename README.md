# hello-world

Hey there! My name is Kabelo and this is my first GitHub repository.
At the time of writing this I am a second year computer science student, who aims to become a software 
developer. My currnent skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, C++, Java, Python, MYSQL, TypeScript 
and RESTful API,

Right now I am learning Android development, MongoDB, AWS DevOps, Docker and RESTful API with Flask. Later in 
my career I would like to specialise in web security, but for the time being I will be focusing on creating and 
deploying my applications.
